This is a program i compiled to run the SHA256 algorithm. This is for my 4th year Theory of Algorithms module in GMIT.


## Project Description
You must write a program in the C programming language that calculates
the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Secure
Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute
of Standards and Technology. The only pre-requisite is that your program
performs the algorithm â€” you are free to decide what input the algorithm
should be performed on.

## How to run the program
1.1 To run the project, "git clone https://github.com/123kieran/SHA256"

1.2 You can simply navigate to the project.
    "cd SHA256"

1.3 Ensure GCC compiler is installed on the computer.
    Run the command "gcc -o sha256 sha256.c" in command prompt within the folder. 

1.4 Choose the file which you wish to Hash
    "./sha256 sha256"
    In this example I have chosen the program to hash itself.
    
## Additional Features
* Error handling is added to the program. Before opening the file. The program to see if the file is empty and if it is it gives an error message
* Changing to Big endian. The output is checked if in big/little endian. If in little endian, it is changed to big endian as required in sha256 algorithm document
